<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This SRFI is derived from parts of

of the R6RS.
These sections are themselves based on parts of

These procedures provide a hook into the Scheme port system from below, allowing the
creation of custom ports that behave as much as possible like the standard
file, string, and bytevector ports, but that call a procedure to produce
data to input ports or to consume data from output ports.
Procedures for creating ports that transcode
between bytes and characters are an important special
case and are also documented in this SRFI.
</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

None at present.

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>When reading from (or writing to) files, devices, pipes, sockets,
or other sources (or sinks) of data, it's often useful or necessary
to perform one or more transformations on the data.</p>

<p>All of these can be done at a level above Scheme ports, but with some
loss in convenience.  In particular, the high-level Scheme I/O procedures
like <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and <code>display</code>
only accept port arguments.  By making it possible to create custom ports
that accept a low-level read (write) operation, perform a transformation,
and pass it on to some other port, convenience is served.  It is also
straightforward to chain custom ports together
in order to create transformation pipelines.</p>

<p>Examples of such transformations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>compression and decompression</li>
<li>encryption and decryption</li>
<li>character encoding and decoding</li>
<li>concatenation of multiple input ports</li>
<li>broadcasting to multiple output ports simultaneously</li>
<li>input ports that echo their input to a specified output port</li>
<li>ports which read from or write to a port<br>
which is the value of a parameter at the time of the read or write</li>
<li>script transliteration</li>
<li>code obfuscation</li>
</ul>

<p>A very important case of transformation is character encoding
and decoding.  It's sometimes useful or necessary
to handle textual data that are encoded differently from the system default encoding.
This SRFI provides comprehensive facilities for handling
many different encodings by creating a custom textual port on top of a binary port.
</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>Note: The effect of <code>char-ready?</code> and <code>u8-ready?</code>
on custom ports is unspecified.</p>

<h3>Custom ports in general</h3>

<p>The types of the arguments to the procedures of this section of this SRFI
are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <i>id</i> is an arbitrary object.
It is meant to be used to help the implementation
distinguish ports.
This SRFI does not provide any mechanism to
retrieve the id from a port.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>read!</i> and <i>write!</i> arguments
are procedures that behave as specified below.
<li><p>The <i>get-position</i> and <i>set-position!</i>
arguments may be procedures or <code>#f</code>, in which case calls to
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/scheme-requests-for-implementation">
SRFI 191</a> <code>port-position</code> and <code>set-port-position!</code>
respectively on the procedures are errors.
<li><p>The <i>close</i> argument may be a procedure
that takes no arguments
and performs any required actions when the port is closed,
or <code>#f</code>, in which case no action is taken.
<li><p>The optional <i>flush</i> argument may be a procedure
that takes no arguments
and performs any necessary actions when the port is flushed,
or <code>#f</code> or omitted, in which case no action is taken.
</ul>


<div><code>(make-custom-binary-input-port </code><i>id</i> <i>read!</i>
<i>get-position</i>&nbsp;<i>set-position!</i>&nbsp;<i>close</i>)</div><p>
Returns a newly created binary input port whose byte source is
an arbitrary algorithm represented by the <i>read!</i> procedure.
<ul>
<li><p>(<i>read!</i> <i>bytevector</i> <i>start</i> <i>count</i>)</p>
<p>It is an error if the following conditions on the arguments are not met:
<i>start</i> is a non-negative exact integer,
<i>count</i> is a positive exact integer,
and <i>bytevector</i> is a bytevector whose length is at least
<i>start</i>  +  <i>count</i>.
<p>The <i>read!</i> procedure obtains up to <i>count</i> bytes
from the byte source, and writes those bytes
into <i>bytevector</i> starting at index <i>start</i>.
The <i>read!</i> procedure returns an exact integer.  This
integer represents the number of bytes that it has read.  To indicate
an end of file, the <i>read!</i>
procedure writes no bytes to its bytevector and returns 0.</p>
<li><p>(<i>get-position</i>)</p>
<p>
The <i>get-position</i> procedure returns some implementation-dependent
object representing as much of the state of the port at its current position
as is necessary to save and restore that position.
This value may be useful only as
the <i>pos</i> argument to <i>set-position!</i>, if the latter is
even supported on the port (see below).</p>
<p>However, if the object is an exact integer,
then it is the position measured in bytes,
which coincides with the position that
the next call of <i>read!</i> procedure reads from,
and can be used to compute a new position some
specified number of bytes away.
</p>
<li><p>(<i>set-position!</i> <i>pos</i>)</p>
<p>
It is implementation-defined what happens if
<i>pos</i> is neither the return value of a call to <i>port-position</i>
on <i>port</i>, in which case
the position is reset to that point,
nor an exact integer, in which
case the port position is set to the specified number of bytes from
the beginning of the port data. If this is not sufficient information
to specify the port state, or the specified position is uninterpretable
by the port, an error is signaled.
</p>
</ul>
<div><code>(make-custom-textual-input-port </code><i>id</i> <i>read!</i>
<i>get-position</i>&nbsp;<i>set-position!</i>&nbsp;<i>close</i>)</div><p>
Returns a newly created textual input port whose character source is
an arbitrary algorithm represented by the <i>read!</i> procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(<i>read!</i> <i>string-or-char-vector</i> <i>start</i> <i>count</i>)</p>
<p>
<p>It is an error if the following conditions on the arguments are not met:
<i>start</i> is a non-negative exact integer,
<i>count</i> is a positive exact integer,
and <i>string-or-char-vector</i> is either a string
or a vector containing characters, at the implementations's option.
In either case its length is at least <i>start</i>  +  <i>count</i>.
<p>The <i>read!</i> procedure obtains up to <i>count</i> characters
from the character source, and writes those characters
into <i>string-or-char-vector</i> starting at index <i>start</i>.
It must be prepared to receive either a string or a vector of characters.
The <i>read!</i> procedure returns an exact integer
representing the number of characters that it has written.
To indicate an end of file, the <i>read!</i>
procedure writes no bytes to the buffer and returns 0.</p></li>
<li><p>(<i>get-position</i>)</p>
<p>
The <i>get-position</i> procedure returns an
implementation-defined object representing the current position of
the input port, which coincides with the position
the next call of <i>read!</i> procedure reads from.
<li><p>(<i>set-position!</i> <i>pos</i>)</p>
<p>
It is an error if <i>pos</i> does not belong to the correct
implementation-defined type.
The <i>set-position!</i> procedure sets the
position of the input port to <i>pos</i>.
</ul>
<div><code>(make-custom-binary-output-port </code>id
<i>write!</i>&nbsp;<i>get-position</i>&nbsp;<i>set-position!</i>&nbsp;<i>close</i> [<i>flush</i>])</div><p>
Returns a newly created binary output port whose byte sink is
an arbitrary algorithm represented by the <i>write!</i> procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(<i>write!</i> <i>bytevector</i> <i>start</i> <i>count</i>)</p>
<p>
<p>It is an error if the following conditions on the arguments are not met:
<i>start</i> and <i>count</i> are non-negative exact
integers,
and <i>bytevector</i> is a bytevector whose length is at least
<i>start</i>  +  <i>count</i>.
<p>The <i>write!</i> procedure writes up to <i>count</i> bytes
from <i>bytevector</i> starting at index <i>start</i>
to the byte sink.
The <i>write!</i> procedure returns the number of
bytes that it wrote, as an exact integer.
</p>
<li><p>(<i>get-position</i>)</p>
<p>
The <i>get-position</i> procedure returns some implementation-dependent
object representing as much of the state of the port at its current position
as is necessary to save and restore that position.
This value may be useful only as
the <i>pos</i> argument to <i>set-position!</i>, if the latter is
even supported on the port (see below).</p>
<p>However, if the object is an exact integer,
then it is the position measured in bytes,
which coincides with the position that
the next call of <i>write!</i> procedure writes to,
and can be used to compute a new position some
specified number of bytes away.
</p>
<li><p>(<i>set-position!</i> <i>pos</i>)</p>
  <p>It is implementation-defined what happens if
<i>pos</i> is neither the return value of a call to <i>port-position</i>
on <i>port</i>, in which case
the position is reset to that point,
nor an exact integer, in which
case the port position is set to the specified number of bytes from
the beginning of the port data. If this is not sufficient information
to specify the port state, or the specified position is uninterpretable
by the port, an error is signaled.
</p>
</ul>
<div><code>(make-custom-textual-output-port </code><i>id</i>
<i>write!</i>&nbsp;<i>get-position</i>&nbsp;<i>set-position!</i>&nbsp;<i>close</i> [<i>flush</i>])</div><p>
Returns a newly created textual output port whose character sink is
an arbitrary algorithm represented by the <i>write!</i> procedure.
<ul>
<li><p>(<i>write!</i> <i>string-or-char-vector</i> <i>start</i> <i>count</i>)</p>
<p>
<p>It is an error if the following conditions on the arguments are not met:
<i>start</i> and <i>count</i> are non-negative exact
integers,
and <i>string-or-char-vector</i> is either a string
or a vector containing characters, at the implementations's option.
In either case its length is at least <i>start</i>  +  <i>count</i>.
<p>The <i>write!</i> procedure writes up to <i>count</i> characters
from <i>string-or-char-vector</i> starting at index <i>start</i>
to the character sink.
In any case, the <i>write!</i> procedure returns the number of
characters that it wrote, as an exact integer.
</p>
<li><p>(<i>get-position</i>)</p>
<p>
The <i>get-position</i> procedure returns an implementation-defined object
representing the current position of the input port,
which coincides with the position the next call of <i>write!</i> writes to.
<li><p>(<i>set-position!</i> <i>pos</i>)</p>
<p>
<i>Pos</i> is a non-negative exact integer.
The <i>set-position!</i> procedure sets the
position of the input port to <i>pos</i>.
</ul>
<div><code>(make-custom-binary-input/output-port </code><i>id</i> <i>read!</i> <i>write!</i>
<i>get-position</i>&nbsp;<i>set-position!</i>&nbsp;<i>close</i> [<i>flush</i>])</div><p>
Returns a newly created binary port that is both an input and an
output port.  Its byte source and sink are arbitrary algorithms
represented by the <i>read!</i> and <i>write!</i> procedures.
Each of the arguments behaves as specified in the description of
<code>make-custom-binary-input</code> (for <i>read!</i>) or
<code>make-custom-binary-output-port</code> (for the other arguments).</p>
<p>Note: R6RS provides custom textual input/output ports (i.e. textual
ports that support both input and output), but they are difficult to
implement and there are no clear use cases for them, so they have been
removed from this SRFI.</p>

<div><code>(make-file-error</code>&nbsp;<i>obj</i> ...)</div><p>
Returns an object which satisfies the R7RS-small predicate
<code>file-error?</code>.
The use of the <i>objs</i> is implementation-defined.
Custom ports may raise the result of this procedure
from their <i>open</i> procedures.</p>

<h2>Transcoded ports</h2>
<p>In order to create a port that transcodes between characters and bytes,
it is necessary to have a <i>transcoder</i> available.
The following sections explain how to create and use transcoders.</p>
<h3>Transcoders</h3>
<p>
A <em>transcoder</em> is an immutable Scheme object that combines
a codec, an end-of-line style, and an error-handling mode
(see the following sections for details).
Each transcoder represents some specific bidirectional (but not
necessarily lossless), possibly stateful translation between byte
sequences and the Scheme-level characters and strings
allowed by the implementation.
Every transcoder can decode bytes as characters
and encode characters as bytes.
</p>
<div><code>(make-transcoder<i> codec eol-style handling-mode</i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns a transcoder with the behavior specified by its arguments.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div><code>(native-transcoder<i></i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns an implementation-dependent transcoder that represents a
possibly locale-dependent &ldquo;native&rdquo; transcoding.
This should be equivalent to the transcoder employed by
Scheme operations that open textual ports.</p>

<div><code>(<a id="node_idx_650"></a>transcoded-port<i> binary-port transcoder</i>)</code><span style="margin-left: .5em">&zwnj;</span><span style="margin-left: .5em">&zwnj;</span>procedure&nbsp;</div>
<p>
Returns a new textual port with the specified <i>transcoder</i>
from <i>binary-port</i>.
The new textual port's externally visible state is largely the same as
that of <i>binary-port</i>.
If <i>binary-port</i> is an input port, the new textual
port will be an input port and
will decode the bytes of <i>binary-port</i>.
If <i>binary-port</i> is an output port, the new textual
port will be an output port and
will write encoded characters to <i>binary-port</i>.
<p>
It is an error to call this procedure on <i>binary-port</i>
after it has been read from or written to.
It is also an error to read or write on <i>binary-port</i>
after calling this procedure.
</p>
<div><code>(bytevector-&gt;string<i> bytevector transcoder</i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns the string that results from decoding the
<i>bytevector</i> according to the input direction of the transcoder.
</p>
<div><code>(string-&gt;bytevector<i> string transcoder</i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns the bytevector that results from encoding the
<i>string</i> according to the output direction of the transcoder.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Codecs</h3>
<p>
Several different character encoding schemes exist that describe standard ways to
encode characters and strings as byte sequences and to decode those
sequences.
Within this document, a <em>codec</em> is an immutable Scheme
object that represents a specific encoding scheme.
A codec has one or more names, represented as strings,
and whatever other properties it
requires in order to implement specific rules for
encoding and decoding.</p>
<div><code>(make-codec <i>string</i>)</code></div>
<p>Returns a codec representing the character encoding scheme one of
whose names matches the string <i>string</i> case-insensitively.</p>
<p>Some character names, encodings and corresponding algorithms can
be found at the <a href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/">
WHATWG encoding specification</a>, and implementations should
recognize and support all of these that are feasible given space
constraints.  There are a total of 39 encodings, which have between
them 218 standard names.  Note that the "replacement" codec signals
an error whenever it is used.  Additional encodings listed at the
IANA page on character sets are not recommended.</p>
<p>If <code>make-codec</code> is called
on a string that the implementation does not support,
an error satisfying <code>unknown-encoding-error?</code> is signaled.</p>

<div><code>(latin-1-codec<i></i>)</code></div>
<div><code>(utf-8-codec<i></i>)</code></div>
<div><code>(utf-16-codec<i></i>)</code></div>
<p>
These are predefined codecs for the ISO 8859-1, UTF-8,
and UTF-16 encoding schemes.
When decoding, the implementation must respect any BOM present, but
the implementation may assume either endianness if no BOM is present.
When encoding, whether a BOM is output and what endianness is used
are implementation-dependent.
A call to any of these procedures returns a value that is equal in the
sense of <code>eqv?</code> to the result of any other call to the same
procedure.

<div><code>(unknown-encoding-error?&nbsp;<i>obj</i>)</code></div>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <i>obj</i> is a condition object
raised by <code>make-codec</code> or one of a set of implementation-defined
objects.<p>
<div><code>(unknown-encoding-error-name&nbsp;<i>unknown-encoding-obj</i>)</code></div>
<p>Extracts the name of the unknown encoding from <i>unknown-encoding-obj</i>
and returns it as a string.  It is an error to mutate this string.</p>
<h3>End-of-line styles</h3>
<p>
An <em>end-of-line style</em> is a symbol that
describes how a textual port transcodes representations of
line endings.
In order to conform to this SRFI, implementations must
support at least three kinds of line endings:
a <code>#\newline</code> character,
a <code>#\return</code> character, and
a <code>#\return</code> followed by a <code><code>#\newline</code></code>,
which is known as a <i>CRLF sequence</i>.
Note that these match the line endings recognized by the R7RS
<code>read-line</code> procedure even when invoked on a non-transcoding port.
Implementations may support other line endings as well.</p>
<p>
The end-of-line style symbol <code>none</code>
means that no line ending conversion is performed in either direction.
On an input port, any other symbol will convert
any line ending into a <code>#\newline</code> character.
On an output port, the symbol <code>crlf</code> causes
any line ending to be output as a CRLF sequence,
whereas the symbol <code>lf</code> causes
any line ending to be output
as a <code>#\newline</code> character,
All other characters remain unchanged.
Implementations may support additional symbols.</p>
<div><code>(native-eol-style<i></i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns the default end-of-line style of the underlying platform, typically
<code>lf</code> on Unix and <code>crlf</code> on Windows.
</p>
<h3>Error-handling modes</h3>
<p>
An <em>error-handling mode</em> is a symbol that
specifies the behavior
of textual I/O operations in the presence of encoding or decoding
errors.</p>
<p>
If a textual input operation encounters an invalid or incomplete
character encoding,
then if the error-handling mode is <code>replace</code>, the erroneous bytes
are treated as the character <code>#\xFFFD;</code>, or if that character is
not representable by the implementation or is not permitted in
strings, then by the character <code>#\?</code> (question mark).
But if the error-handling mode is <code>raise</code>,
an error satisfying <code>i/o-decoding-error?</code> is signaled,
an appropriate number of bytes are ignored, and decoding
continues with the following bytes.</p>
<p>
If a textual output operation encounters a character it cannot encode,
and if the error-handling mode is <code>replace</code>, a
replacement character is encoded instead, and encoding
continues with the next character.
The replacement character is <code>#\xFFFD</code> for transcoders
that can encode this character, but is <code>#\?</code> (question mark)
for transcoders that cannot.
But if the error-handling mode is <code>raise</code>, an
an error satisfying <code>i/o-encoding-error?</code> is raised,
and encoding continues with the next character.
</p>
<p>
Implementations may support additional symbols.</p>
<div><code>(i/o-decoding-error?<i> obj</i>)</code></div>

<p>
Returns <code>#t</code> if <i>obj</i> is
an exception raised when one of the operations for
textual input from a port encounters a sequence of bytes that cannot
be decoded into a character or string by the port's transcoder.</p>
<p>
When such an exception is raised, the port's position is past
the invalid encoding.
</p>
<div><code>(i/o-encoding-error?<i> obj</i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns <code>#t</code> if <i>obj</i> is
an exception raised when one of the operations for
textual output to a port encounters a character that cannot be
encoded into bytes by the port's transcoder.</p>
<div><code>(i/o-encoding-error-char<i> i/o-encoding-condition</i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns the character that could not be encoded
when the condition <i>i/o-encoding-condition</i> was signaled.
</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>Every conforming R6RS implementation, including at least Chez, IronScheme,
Larceny, Racket, and Vicare, already provides these procedures
in the <code>(rnrs io ports)</code> library, with the exceptions
of <code>make-file-error</code>, which will already exist though
not necessarily be exposed,
and of <code>make-codec</code>,
<code>unknown-encoding-error?</code>, and
<code>unknown-encoding-error-name</code>.
Therefore, no implementation is provided here, especially since
a portable implementation is not possible.</p>

<p>However, strictly conforming R6RS implementations will not accept the
<i>flush</i> argument, though a wrapper to accept and ignore it would be
trivial.  Furthermore, the <i>read!</i> and <i>write!</i> procedures
will never be passed a vector of characters, but always a string.</p>

<p>This SRFI can be implemented on top of the Chicken
procedures <code>make-input-port</code> and <code>make-output-port</code>
in the <code>(chicken ports)</code> library.
Chicken makes
makes no provisions for getting and setting positions on either its
built-in ports or custom ones.  It also does not
distinguish between textual and binary ports (as permitted by R7RS), and its strings
can store binary data; indeed, interpretation as characters
is up to a higher-level library such as the <code>utf8</code> egg.

<p>Shiro Kawai has provided a sample implementation that illustrates
both transcoded ports and SRFI 192.  It includes a positionable
vector-backed custom port library to illustrate the use case of custom
ports.  The sample implementation, including the examples, can be
found in the <a href="https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-192">Git
repository</a> for SRFI 192 and in <a
href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-192/srfi-192.tgz">this .tgz
archive</a>.</p>

<h3>Port positioning and peeking</h3>

<p>The following considerations must be applied when <code>peek-char</code>
and <code>peek-u8</code> are used on custom ports.  Much of the
following is derived from Shiro Kawai's README file in the SRFI 192
implementation:</p>

<p>If the source of characters or bytes (collectively known as
<i>elements</i>) underlying a custom input port is natively
positionable (either because the source is itself a positionable port or because
it is a random-access data structure like a list, vector, or string),
then the custom port can support the SRFI 192 and R6RS procedures
<code>port-position</code> and <code>set-port-position!</code>.
This is true even if reading an element from the custom port involves
reading a variable number of elements from the source.
If on the other hand the source is not seekable,
the <i>get-position</i> procedure can simply return
the number of elements read from it so far,
whereas the <i>set-position!</i> argument should be
set to <code>#f</code>, in which case
<code>set-port-position!</code> will be disabled.</p>

<p>However, the Scheme implementation's port system must
cache the position of a custom port before peeking it, because
it may not be possible for the port to rewind its position.
The peeked element is also cached, so that on the next
read it can be returned.
But if <code>port-position</code> is called before the
peeked character is read, the port must return its
cached position rather than calling the <i>get-position</i>
procedure.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

This SRFI would have been much more difficult to write without the R6RS team,
who produced a good-enough (as opposed to perfect) design
that John was happy to adopt.  Thanks also to Mikel More,
who convinced him of the necessity of having custom and transcoded ports in R7RS-large.
