<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>This SRFI is a lightly edited version of parts of
<a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-lib/r6rs-lib-Z-H-9.html#node_sec_8.2.7">
library section 8.2.7</a>,
<a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-lib/r6rs-lib-Z-H-9.html#node_sec_8.2.10">
library section 8.2.10</a>, and
<a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-lib/r6rs-lib-Z-H-9.html#node_sec_8.2.13">
library section 8.2.13</a>
of the R6RS.
These sections are themselves based on parts of
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-79/srfi-79.html">SRFI 79</a>.
These procedures provide support for transcoders and transcoded ports.</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

None at present.

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>When reading from (or writing to) files, devices, pipes, sockets,
or other sources (or sinks) of data, it's often useful or necessary
to include one or more transformations on the data.</p>

<p>All of these can be done at a level above Scheme ports, but with some
loss in convenience.  In particular, the high-level Scheme I/O procedures
like <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and <code>display</code>
only accept port arguments.  By making it possible to create custom ports
that accept a low-level read (write) operation, perform a transformation,
and pass it on to some other port, convenience is served.  It is also
straightforward to chain custom ports together
in order to create transformation pipelines.</p>

<p>Examples of such transformations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>compression and decompression</li>
<li>encryption and decryption</li>
<li>character encoding and decoding</li>
<li>concatenation of multiple input ports</li>
<li>broadcasting to multiple output ports simultaneously</li>
<li>input ports that echo their input to a specified output port</li>
<li>ports which read from or write to a port<br>
which is the value of a parameter at the time of the read or write</li>
<li>script transliteration</li>
<li>object serialization and deserialization</li>
<li>code obfuscation</li>
</ul>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>The types of the arguments to the procedures of this SRFI
are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <i>read!</i> and <i>write!</i> arguments
are procedures that behave as specified below.
<li><p>The <i>get-position</i> and <i>set-position</i>
arguments may be procedures or <code>#f</code>, in which case calls to
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/scheme-requests-for-implementation">
SRFI 191</a> <code>port-position</code> and <code>set-port-position!</code>
respectively on the procedures are errors.
<li><p>The <i>close</i> arguments may be a procedure
that takes any required actions when the port is closed,
or <code>#f</code>, in which case no action is taken.
<li><p>The optional <i>flush</i> argument may be a procedure
that takes any necessary actions when the port is flushed,
or <code>#f</code> or omitted, in which case no action is taken.
</ul>

<p>The effect of the following procedures on custom ports is undefined:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>char-ready?</code></li>
<li><code>u8-ready?</code></li>
<li><code>peek-char?</code></li>
<li><code>peek-u8?</code></li>
</ul>

<div align=left><code>(make-custom-binary-input-port </code><i>id</i> <i>read!</i>
<i>get-position</i>&nbsp;<i>set-position!</i>&nbsp;<i>close</i>)</code></div><p>
Returns a newly created binary input port whose byte source is
an arbitrary algorithm represented by the <i>read!</i> procedure.
<ul>
<li><p>(<i>read!</i> <i>bytevector</i> <i>start</i> <i>count</i>)</p>
<p>It is an error if the following conditions on the arguments are not met:
<i>start</i> is a non-negative exact integer,
<i>count</i> is a positive exact integer,
and <i>bytevector</i> is a bytevector whose length is at least
<i>start</i>  +  <i>count</i>.
<p>The <i>read!</i> procedure obtains up to <i>count</i> bytes
from the byte source, and writes those bytes
into <i>bytevector</i> starting at index <i>start</i>.
The <i>read!</i> procedure returns an exact integer.  This
To indicate an end of file, the <i>read!</i>
integer represents the number of bytes that it has read.
procedure writes no bytes to its bytevector and returns 0.</p>
<li><p>(<i>get-position</i>)</p>
<p>
The <i>get-position</i> procedure returns an exact
integer representing the current byte position of the input port.
<li><p>(<i>set-position!</i> <i>pos</i>)</p>
<p>
<p>It is an error if <i>pos</i> is not a non-negative exact integer.
The <i>set-position!</i> procedure sets the byte
position of the input port to <i>pos</i>.
</ul>
<div align=left><code>(make-custom-textual-input-port </code><i>id</i> <i>read!</i>
<i>get-position</i>&nbsp;<i>set-position!</i>&nbsp;<i>close</i>)</code></div><p>
Returns a newly created textual input port whose character source is
an arbitrary algorithm represented by the <i>read!</i> procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(<i>read!</i> <i>string-or-char-vector</i> <i>start</i> <i>count</i>)</p>
<p>
<p>It is an error if the following conditions on the arguments are not met:
<i>start</i> is a non-negative exact integer,
<i>count</i> is a positive exact integer,
and <i>string-or-char-vector</i> is either a string
or a vector containing characters, at the implementations's option.
In either case its length is at least <i>start</i>  +  <i>count</i>.
<p>The <i>read!</i> procedure obtains up to <i>count</i> characters
from the character source, and writes those characters
into <i>string-or-char-vector</i> starting at index <i>start</i>;
it must be prepared to receive either a string or a vector of characters.
The <i>read!</i> procedure returns an exact integer
representing the number of characters that it has written.
To indicate an end of file, the <i>read!</i>
procedure writes no bytes to the buffer and returns 0.</p></li>
<li><p>(<i>get-position</i>)</p>
<p>
The <i>get-position</i> procedure returns an
implementation-defined object representing the current position of
the input port. 
<li><p>(<i>set-position!</i> <i>pos</i>)</p>
<p>
It is an error if <i>pos</i> does not belong to the correct
implementation-defined type.
The <i>set-position!</i> procedure sets the
position of the input port to <i>pos</i>.
</ul>
<div align=left><code>(make-custom-binary-output-port </code>id</i>
<i>write!</i>&nbsp;<i>get-position</i>&nbsp;<i>set-position!</i>&nbsp;<i>close</i> [<i>flush</i>])</code></div><p>
Returns a newly created binary output port whose byte sink is
an arbitrary algorithm represented by the <i>write!</i> procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(<i>write!</i> <i>bytevector</i> <i>start</i> <i>count</i>)</p>
<p>
<p>It is an error if the following conditions on the arguments are not met:
<i>start</i> and <i>count</i> is non-negative exact
integers,
and <i>bytevector</i> is a bytevector whose length is at least
<i>start</i>  +  <i>count</i>.
<p>The <i>write!</i> procedure writes up to <i>count</i> bytes
from <i>bytevector</i> starting at index <i>start</i> 
to the byte sink.
The <i>write!</i> procedure returns the number of
bytes that it wrote, as an exact integer.
</p>
<li><p>(<i>get-position</i>)</p>
<p>
The <i>get-position</i> procedure returns an exact
integer representing the current byte position of the output port.
<li><p>(<i>set-position!</i> <i>pos</i>)</p>
<p>
<i>Pos</i> is a non-negative exact integer.
The <i>set-position!</i> procedure sets the
position of the output port to <i>pos</i>.
</ul>
<div align=left><code>(make-custom-textual-output-port </code><i>id</i>
<i>write!</i>&nbsp;<i>get-position</i>&nbsp;<i>set-position!</i>&nbsp;<i>close</i> [<i>flush</i>])</code></div><p>
Returns a newly created textual output port whose character sink is
an arbitrary algorithm represented by the <i>write!</i> procedure.
<ul>
<li><p>(<i>write!</i> <i>string-or-char-vector</i> <i>start</i> <i>count</i>)</p>
<p>
<p>It is an error if the following conditions on the arguments are not met:
<i>start</i> and <i>count</i> is non-negative exact
integers,
and <i>string-or-char-vector</i> is either a string
or a vector containing characters, at the implementations's option.
In either case its length is at least <i>start</i>  +  <i>count</i>.
<p>The <i>write!</i> procedure writes up to <i>count</i> characters
from <i>string-or-char-vector</i> starting at index <i>start</i> 
to the character sink.
In any case, the <i>write!</i> procedure returns the number of
characters that it wrote, as an exact integer.
</p>
<li><p>(<i>get-position</i>)</p>
<p>
The <i>get-position</i> procedure returns an exact
integer representing the current position of
the input port.
<li><p>(<i>set-position!</i> <i>pos</i>)</p>
<p>
<i>Pos</i> is a non-negative exact integer.
The <i>set-position!</i> procedure sets the
position of the input port to <i>pos</i>.
</ul>
<div align=left><code>(make-custom-binary-input/output-port </code><i>id</i> <i>read!</i> <i>write!</i>
<i>get-position</i>&nbsp;<i>set-position!</i>&nbsp;<i>close</i> [<i>flush</i>])</code></div><p>
Returns a newly created binary port that is both an input and an
output port.  Its byte source and sink are arbitrary algorithms
represented by the <i>read!</i> and <i>write!</i> procedures.
Each of the arguments behaves as specified in the description of
<code>make-custom-binary-input-port</code> or
<code>make-custom-binary-output-port</code> as the case may be.</p>
<p>Note: R6RS provides custom textual input/output ports, but
they are difficult to implement and there are no clear use cases
for them, so they have been removed from this SRFI.</p>

<div align=left><code>(make-file-error</code>&nbsp;<i>obj</i> ...)</code></div><p>
Returns an object which satisfies the R7RS-small predicate
<code>file-error?</code>.
The use of the <i>objs</i> is implementation-defined.
Custom ports may raise the result of this procedure
from their <i>open</i> procedures.</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>Every conforming R6RS implementation, including at least Chez, Guile, IronScheme,
Larceny, Racket, and Vicare, already provides these procedures
in the <code>(rnrs io ports)</code> library, with the exception of the
<code>make-file-error</code> procedure, which will already exist, though
not necessarily be exposed, in most Schemes.
Therefore, no implementation is provided here, especially since 
a portable implementation is not possible.</p>

<p>However, strictly conforming R6RS implementations will not accept the
<i>flush</i> argument, though a wrapper to accept and ignore it would be
trivial.  Furthermore, the <i>read!</i> and <i>write!</i> procedures
will never be passed a vector of characters, but always a string.</p>

<p>This SRFI can trivially be implemented on top of the Chicken
procedures <code>make-input-port</code> and <code>make-output-port</code>
in the <code>(chicken ports)</code> library.
Chicken makes
makes no provisions for getting and setting positions on either its
built-in ports or custom ones.  It also does not
distinguish between textual and binary ports (as permitted by R7RS), and its strings
can store binary data; indeed, interpretation as characters
is up to a higher-level library such as the <code>utf8</code> egg.

<p>Shiro Kawai has provided a sample implementation that illustates
both SRFI 181 and SRFI 192.  It can be found in the <a
href="https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-192">Git
repository</a> for SRFI 192 and in <a
href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-192/srfi-192.tgz">this .tgz
archive</a>.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

This would have been much more difficult without the R6RS team,
who produced a good-enough (as opposed to perfect) design
that John was happy to adopt.  Thanks also to Mikel More,
who convinced him of the necessity of having custom ports in R7RS-large.
