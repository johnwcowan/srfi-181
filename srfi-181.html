<p>This SRFI is a lightly edited version of parts of

of the R6RS.
These sections are themselves based on parts of
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-79/srfi-79.html">SRFI 79</a>,
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-80/srfi-80.html">SRFI 80</a> and
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-81/srfi-81.html">SRFI 81</a>.
These procedures provide a hook into the Scheme port system from below, allowing the
creation of custom ports that behave as much as possible like the standard
file, string, and bytevector ports, but that call a procedure to produce
data to input ports or to consume data from output ports.
Procedures for creating ports that transcode
between bytes and characters are an important special
case and are also documented in this SRFI.
</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

None at present.

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>When reading from (or writing to) files, devices, pipes, sockets,
or other sources (or sinks) of data, it's often useful or necessary
to perform one or more transformations on the data.</p>

<p>All of these can be done at a level above Scheme ports, but with some
loss in convenience.  In particular, the high-level Scheme I/O procedures
like <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and <code>display</code>
only accept port arguments.  By making it possible to create custom ports
that accept a low-level read (write) operation, perform a transformation,
and pass it on to some other port, convenience is served.  It is also
straightforward to chain custom ports together
in order to create transformation pipelines.</p>

<p>Examples of such transformations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>compression and decompression</li>
<li>encryption and decryption</li>
<li>character encoding and decoding</li>
<li>concatenation of multiple input ports</li>
<li>broadcasting to multiple output ports simultaneously</li>
<li>input ports that echo their input to a specified output port</li>
<li>ports which read from or write to a port<br>
which is the value of a parameter at the time of the read or write</li>
<li>script transliteration</li>
<li>object serialization and deserialization</li>
<li>code obfuscation</li>
</ul>

<p>A very important case of transformation is character encoding
and decoding.  It's sometimes useful or necessary
to handle textual data that are encoded differently from the system default encoding.
This SRFI provides comprehensive facilities for handling
many different encodings by creating a custom textual port on top of a binary port.
</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>Note: The effect of <code>char-ready?</code> and <code>u8-ready?</code>
on custom ports is unspecified.</p>

Each of the arguments behaves as specified in the description of
<code>make-custom-binary-input-port</code> or
<code>make-custom-binary-output-port</code> as the case may be.</p>
<p>Note: R6RS provides custom textual input/output ports (i.e. textual
ports that support both input and output), but they are difficult to
implement and there are no clear use cases for them, so they have been
removed from this SRFI.</p>

<div align=left><code>(make-file-error</code>&nbsp;<i>obj</i> ...)</code></div><p>
Returns an object which satisfies the R7RS-small predicate
<code>file-error?</code>.
The use of the <i>objs</i> is implementation-defined.
Custom ports may raise the result of this procedure
from their <i>open</i> procedures.</p>

<h2>Transcoded ports</h2>

<h3>Codecs</h3>
<p>
Several different character encoding schemes exist that describe standard ways to
encode characters and strings as byte sequences and to decode those
sequences.
Within this document, a </a><em>codec</em> is an immutable Scheme
object that represents a specific encoding scheme.
A codec has one or more names, represented as strings,
and whatever other properties it
requires in order to implement specific rules for
encoding and decoding.</p>
<h3>End-of-line styles</h3>
<p>
An <em>end-of-line style</em> is a symbol that
describes how a textual port transcodes representations of
line endings.
In order to conform to this SRFI, implementations must
support at least three kinds of line endings:
a U+000A (newline) character,
a U+000D (return) character, and
an U+000D followed by a U+000A (a CRLF sequence).
Implementations may support other line endings as well.</p>
<p>
The end-of-line style symbol <code>none</code>
means that no line ending conversion is performed in either direction.
On an input port, any other symbol will convert
any line ending into a <code>#\newline</code> character.
On an output port, the symbol <code>crlf</code> causes
any line ending to be output as a CRLF sequence,
but the symbol <code>lf</code> causes
any line ending to be output
as a <code>#\newline</code> character,
All other characters remain unchanged.
Implementations may support additional symbols.</p>
<h3>Error-handling modes</h3>
<p>
An <em>error-handling mode</em> is a symbol that
specifies the behavior
of textual I/O operations in the presence of encoding or decoding
errors.</p>
<p>
If a textual input operation encounters an invalid or incomplete
character encoding,
then if the error-handling mode is <code>replace</code>, the replacement
it is treated as the character U+FFFD, or if that character is
not representable by the implementation or is not permitted in
strings, then by the character U+003F (question mark).
But if the error-handling mode is <code>raise</code>,
an error satisfying <code>i/o-decoding-error?</code> is signaled,
an appropriate number of bytes are ignored, and decoding
continues with the following bytes.</p>
<p>
If a textual output operation encounters a character it cannot encode,
then if the error-handling mode is <code>replace</code>, a codec-specific
replacement character is emitted by the transcoder, and encoding
continues with the next character.
The replacement character is U+FFFD for transcoders whose codec
can encode this character, but is U+003F (question mark)
if it cannot.
But if the error-handling mode is <code>raise</code>, an
an error satisfying <code>i/o-encoding-error?</code> is raised,
and encoding continues with the next character.
</p>
<p>
Implementations may support additional symbols.</p>
<h3>Transcoders</h3>
<p>
A <em>transcoder</em> is an immutable Scheme object that combines
a codec, an end-of-line style, and an error-handling mode.
Each transcoder represents some specific bidirectional (but not
necessarily lossless), possibly stateful translation between byte
sequences and the Scheme-level characters and strings
allowed by the implementation.
Every transcoder can decode bytes as characters
and encode characters as bytes.
</p>
<h3>Procedures</h3>
<div><code>(</a>make-codec <i>string</i>)</code></div>
<p>Returns a codec representing
the character encoding scheme one of whose
whose names is the case-insensitive string <i>string</i>.</p>
<p>Some  character encoding names can be found at
<a href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels">
the WHATWG encoding specification</a>, and implementations
should recognize and support all of these.
There are a total of 39 encodings, which have between them
218 standard names.  Note that the "replacement" codec
signals an error whenever it is used.
Additional encoding names listed at
<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml">
the IANA page on character sets</a>
may also be recognized and supported.</p>
<p>If <code>make-codec</code> is called
on a string that the implementation does not support,
an error is signaled.</p>

<div><code>(latin-1-codec<i></i>)</code></div>
<div><code>(utf-8-codec<i></i>)</code></div>
<div><code>(utf-16-codec<i></i>)</code></div>
<p>
These are predefined codecs for the ISO 8859-1, UTF-8,
and UTF-16 encoding schemes.
When decoding, the implementation must respect any BOM present, but
the implementation may assume either endianness if no BOM is present,
but if no BOM is present, the implementation may assume either endianness.
When encoding, whether a BOM is output and what endianness is used
are implementation-dependent.
A call to any of these procedures returns a value that is equal in the
sense of <code>eqv?</code> to the result of any other call to the same
procedure.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div><code>(native-eol-style<i></i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns the default end-of-line style of the underlying platform, typically
<code>lf</code> on Unix and <code>crlf</code> on Windows.
</p>
<div><code>(i/o-decoding-error?<i> obj</i>)</code></div>

<p>
Returns <code>#t</code> if <i>obj</i> is
an exception raised when one of the operations for
textual input from a port encounters a sequence of bytes that cannot
be decoded into a character or string by the port's transcoder.</p>
<p>
When such an exception is raised, the port's position is past
the invalid encoding.
</p>
<div><code>(i/o-encoding-error?<i> obj</i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns <code>#t</code> if <i>obj</i> is
an exception raised when one of the operations for
textual output to a port encounters a character that cannot be
encoded into bytes by the port's transcoder.</p>
<div><code>(i/o-encoding-error-char<i> i/o-encoding-condition</i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns the character that could not be encoded
when the condition <i>i/o-encoding-condition</i> was signaled.
</p>
<div><code>(make-transcoder<i> codec eol-style handling-mode</i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns a transcoder with the behavior specified by its arguments.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div><code>(native-transcoder<i></i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns an implementation-dependent transcoder that represents a
possibly locale-dependent &ldquo;native&rdquo; transcoding.
This should be equivalent to the transcoder employed by
Scheme operations that open textual ports.</p>
<div><code>(<a id="node_idx_650"></a>transcoded-port<i> binary-port transcoder</i>)</code><span style="margin-left: .5em">&zwnj;</span><span style="margin-left: .5em">&zwnj;</span>procedure&nbsp;</div>
<p>
Returns a new textual port with the specified <i>transcoder</i>
from <i>binary-port</i>.
The new textual port's externally visible state is largely the same as
that of <i>binary-port</i>.
If <i>binary-port</i> is an input port, the new textual
port will be an input port and
will decode the bytes of <i>binary-port</i>.
If <i>binary-port</i> is an output port, the new textual
port will be an output port and
will write encoded characters to <i>binary-port</i>.
<p>
It is an error to call this procedure on <i>binary-port</i>
after it has been read from or written to.
It is also an error to read or write on <i>binary-port</i>
after calling this procedure.
</p>
<div><code>(bytevector-&gt;string<i> bytevector transcoder</i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns the string that results from decoding the
<i>bytevector</i> according to the input direction of the transcoder.
</p>
<div><code>(string-&gt;bytevector<i> string transcoder</i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns the bytevector that results from encoding the
<i>string</i> according to the output direction of the transcoder.
</p>
<p>
</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>Every conforming R6RS implementation, including at least Chez, IronScheme,
Larceny, Racket, and Vicare, already provides these procedures
in the <code>(rnrs io ports)</code> library, with the exceptions
of <code>make-file-error</code>, which will already exist though
not necessarily be exposed,
and of <code>make-codec</code>.
Therefore, no implementation is provided here, especially since 
a portable implementation is not possible.</p>
Therefore, no implementation is provided here, especially since 
a portable implementation is not possible.</p>

<p>However, strictly conforming R6RS implementations will not accept the
<i>flush</i> argument, though a wrapper to accept and ignore it would be
trivial.  Furthermore, the <i>read!</i> and <i>write!</i> procedures
will never be passed a vector of characters, but always a string.</p>

<p>This SRFI can be implemented on top of the Chicken
procedures <code>make-input-port</code> and <code>make-output-port</code>
in the <code>(chicken ports)</code> library.
Chicken makes
makes no provisions for getting and setting positions on either its
built-in ports or custom ones.  It also does not
distinguish between textual and binary ports (as permitted by R7RS), and its strings
can store binary data; indeed, interpretation as characters
is up to a higher-level library such as the <code>utf8</code> egg.

<p>Shiro Kawai has provided a sample implementation that illustrates
both transcoded ports and SRFI 192.  It can be found in the <a
href="https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-192">Git
repository</a> for SRFI 192 and in <a
href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-192/srfi-192.tgz">this .tgz
archive</a>.</p>

This SRFI would have been much more difficult to write without the R6RS team,
who produced a good-enough (as opposed to perfect) design
that John was happy to adopt.  Thanks also to Mikel More,
who convinced him of the necessity of having custom and transcoded ports in R7RS-large.
